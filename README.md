# Sentiment-Analysis

The aim of this project is to create to find the model that best fits the training data and then classify the comments in the testing data. For the same, I tried with four classifiers which are listed below along with testing accuracy - 

 * Multinomial Naive Bayes - 96.61%
 * K Nearest Neighbours - 95.27%
 * Logistic Regression - 97.21%
 * Neural Network (1 hidden layer with 100 nodes) - 99.10-99.30%

Of the above four classifier, neural network outperformed the other four models. The final predictions for the test data are here.
